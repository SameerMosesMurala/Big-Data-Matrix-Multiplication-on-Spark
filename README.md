Project Description
matrix multiplication using Spark and Scala. 
You should modify Multiply.scala only. In your Scala main program, args(0) is the first input matrix M, args(1) is the second input
matrix N, and args(2) is the output directory. There are two small sparce matrices 4*3 and 3*3 in the files M-matrix-small.txt
and N-matrix-small.txt for testing in standalone mode. Their matrix multiplication must return the 4*3 matrix in result-matrix-small.txt
. Then there are 2 moderate-sized matrices 200*100 and 100*300 in the files M-matrix-large.txt and M-matrix-large.txt for testing in
distributed mode.
